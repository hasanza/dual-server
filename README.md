# dual-server
An express server that serves a react app on one route and jQuery views on the rest of them.

The react app is served on the route /react, which is the home for this app, while all other express routes serve the jQuery views. 

To run, clone the repo, cd into the server directory and type 'node index.js' in the local terminal.

If you want to make changes in the react app, run 'npm install' in the local terminal to install the modules.
